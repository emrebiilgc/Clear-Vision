# Clear-Vision
ClearVision Defense is a C++ project for advanced image processing and secure communication, featuring filters, image manipulation, and secret message embedding for defense operations.
The ClearVision Defense application is a C++ project developed for advanced image processing and secure communication in defense operations. It includes functionalities such as image filtering, manipulation, comparison, and secret message embedding within grayscale images. The program features filters like the mean filter for noise reduction through pixel averaging, Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise while preserving edges, and unsharp masking to enhance image sharpness by emphasizing edges. It supports image arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction of pixel values, as well as pixel-by-pixel equality checks for image comparison. For secure storage, images are split into upper and lower triangular matrices, allowing for efficient reconstruction and filtering. Additionally, the application enables secret message embedding into the least significant bits of image pixels for covert communication and provides functionality to extract and decode these messages. Utilizing the stb_image library, the project supports file I/O operations while managing image data dynamically. By integrating advanced C++ concepts such as operator overloading and dynamic memory management, ClearVision Defense highlights practical applications in defense, improving image clarity, safeguarding classified data, and enabling secure communication.
